# Apache Airflow Drag-and-Drop Plugin

&#x20;&#x20;

The **Apache Airflow Drag-and-Drop Plugin** enhances the Apache Airflow UI by allowing users to create and manage workflows using a **drag-and-drop interface**. This plugin simplifies the process of creating DAGs (Directed Acyclic Graphs) by providing an intuitive visual interface.

## Features
```bash
Drag-and-Drop Interface – Easily create and modify DAGs visually. 
Predefined Templates – Use templates for common workflows. 
Custom Operators – Extend the palette with custom operators. 
Real-Time Validation – Validate workflows before deployment. 
Export DAG Code – Save workflows as .py file.

```
